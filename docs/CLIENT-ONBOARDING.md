# ACE GROWTH — CLIENT ONBOARDING

> They paid. Now deliver. This is the process from payment to launch and beyond.

---

## A. KICKOFF CALL AGENDA (30 Minutes)

### Before the Call
- Confirm payment received in Stripe
- Review their current website and Google Business Profile
- Note any obvious wins you can highlight early
- Have the information checklist ready to share

### The Call Structure

**1. Congratulations & Positioning (2 min)**

```
"Welcome aboard. You just made a smart move — you're going to be
the contractor that shows up when people search for [their service]
in [their area]. Let me walk you through exactly what happens next
so there are no surprises."
```

**2. Set Expectations (3 min)**

```
"Here's the timeline. Your site goes live in about two weeks.
During that time, I'll need about 30 minutes of your time today
to get your info, and then I'm heads-down building. You'll see
the first draft around day 7-8, and you'll get two rounds of
revisions. By day 14, we're live and the leads start building.

After launch, I handle everything. Monthly optimization, content,
Google Business Profile, reporting. All I need from you is 15
minutes a month for a check-in call. Sound good?"
```

**3. Collect Information (20 min)**

Walk through the full checklist below. Get as much as possible on this call. Whatever they can't provide right now, set a deadline (48 hours max).

**4. Wrap Up & Next Steps (5 min)**

```
"Great, I've got everything I need to get started. Here's what
happens next:

- I'll confirm design direction with you via text within 48 hours
- You'll see the first draft around [date — day 7-8]
- I'll send a link to review and you'll have 2-3 days for feedback
- Target launch date: [date — day 14]

If you think of anything else or have questions, text me anytime.
(317) 572-7018. Talk soon."
```

## B. INFORMATION CHECKLIST

Send this to the client after the kickoff call as a reference. Collect everything within the first 3 days.

### Required (Must Have)

- [ ] **Google Business Profile login** — Email and password (we need access to optimize)
- [ ] **Logo files** — PNG minimum, SVG/vector preferred
- [ ] **10-20 project photos** — Before/after shots are gold. High resolution.
- [ ] **Headshot or team photo** — Builds trust on the site
- [ ] **Full list of services offered** — Every service they do, even small ones
- [ ] **Service areas** — Cities, neighborhoods, zip codes they want to target
- [ ] **Business hours** — When are they available for calls?
- [ ] **Preferred contact method for leads** — Phone call, form submission, or both?
- [ ] **License number and insurance info** — Builds credibility on site

### Strongly Recommended

- [ ] **Business story / about section** — Their story in their words. If they can't write it, we interview them and write it.
  - How did you start?
  - How long have you been doing this?
  - What makes you different?
  - What do you take the most pride in?
- [ ] **3-5 best customer testimonials** — Written quotes with first name and city. If they don't have these, we pull the best ones from their Google reviews.
- [ ] **Competitor websites they admire** — "Any contractor websites you've seen that you like? Doesn't have to be your trade."

### Nice to Have

- [ ] **Branding guidelines or color preferences** — If they have brand colors, we use them. If not, we choose based on trade and market.
- [ ] **Video content** — Walkthrough of a project, testimonial videos, day-in-the-life footage
- [ ] **Awards, certifications, memberships** — BBB, trade associations, manufacturer certifications
- [ ] **Unique selling points** — Warranties, guarantees, free estimates, same-day service

### How to Collect

**Best method:** During the kickoff call, have them text or email photos and files right there. People forget if you give them homework.

**If they need time:**
```
"No rush on getting everything perfect. But I need the basics —
logo, photos, service list, and GBP login — within 48 hours so
I can start building. Can you get that to me by [day]?"
```

**If they're dragging (past 3 days):**
```
"Hey [Name], just checking in. I'm ready to start building but
need those photos and your GBP login to move forward. Can you
send those over today? Don't want to push back your launch date."
```

→ Frame it as their launch date being at risk, not you nagging.

**What happens:**

- Define site structure and page hierarchy
- Choose design direction (colors, layout, style)
- Send client a quick text confirming direction:
  ```
  "Hey [Name], I've started on your site. Going with [color scheme]
  and focusing on [top 3 services] as the main push. Your top
  keyword targets are [keywords]. I'll have the first draft for
  you around [date]. 👍"
  ```

### Day 8-10: Client Review + Revisions

**Send the draft:**
```
"Hey [Name], your site is ready for review. Here's the link:
[staging URL]

Take a look and let me know:
1. Anything factually wrong? (services, areas, contact info)
2. Any photos you want swapped?
3. Anything you want added or removed?

You get 2 rounds of revisions. Send me everything at once so
I can knock it out. Try to get feedback back to me within 2-3
days so we stay on track for launch."
```

**Revision rules:**
- Max 2 rounds of revisions included
- Revisions = changes to existing content, not redesigns

The system is running. From here, I'm focused on getting you
ranked and generating leads.

## D. COMMUNICATION EXPECTATIONS

Set these on the kickoff call and stick to them.

### What the Client Gets

| Communication | Frequency | Format |
|---------------|-----------|--------|
| Performance report | Monthly | Email |
| Check-in call | Monthly | Phone (15 min) |
| GBP posts | Weekly | Managed by Ace |
| Blog/content updates | 1-2x/month | Managed by Ace |
| Urgent issues | Same day | Text/call |

### Response Times

| Type | Response Time |
|------|--------------|
| Urgent (site down, wrong info live) | Same day |
| Non-urgent questions | 24-48 hours |
| Content/change requests | 3-5 business days |
| Monthly report | Sent by 5th of each month |

### Communication Channel

Primary: **Text message** — most contractors prefer it, it's fast, it's documented.

Secondary: **Phone call** — for kickoff, monthly check-ins, or complex issues.

Email: **Reports only** — contractors don't check email. Don't rely on it for anything time-sensitive.

### Kae's Direct Line

```
(317) 572-7018
```

Clients can text or call directly. Keep it professional but casual. These are contractors, not corporate clients. Be real.

### Monthly Check-In Call Script

```
"Hey [Name], it's your monthly check-in. Quick 15 minutes.

Here's what happened this month:
- Your site got [X] visitors
- You received [X] form submissions and [X] phone calls
- Your top pages were [pages]
- Google ranking for [keyword] moved from [X] to [Y]

Overall, the system generated [X] leads this month. At your
average job value of [$X], that's roughly [$Y] in potential
revenue.

For next month, I'm focusing on [specific plan].

Any questions? How are things going on your end — getting
good quality leads?"
```

→ Listen. If lead quality is an issue, adjust targeting. If volume is low, adjust content strategy. This call is as much about listening as reporting.

## E. RED FLAGS — PROBLEM CLIENTS

Watch for these. Address them early or fire the client.

| Red Flag | What to Do |
|----------|-----------|
| Never provides info/photos | Set hard deadline. "I need this by Friday or launch pushes." |
| Endless revision requests | Remind: 2 rounds included. Additional rounds are billable. |
| Doesn't pay monthly on time | Stripe handles this. If payment fails, pause work. Site stays live but no optimization. |
| Blames you for low close rate | "I generate the leads. You close the jobs. Let's look at lead quality together." |
| Wants to micromanage content | "I appreciate the input. Let me handle the optimization — that's what you're paying for." |
| Expects overnight results | Re-set expectations. "SEO compounds over time. Month 3 is where it really kicks in." |
