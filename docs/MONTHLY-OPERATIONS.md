| **Week 2** | Review monitoring + responses + GBP post | 1-2 hrs |
| **Week 3** | GBP post + conversion optimization check | 1-2 hrs |

---

### Week 2: Review & Reputation Management

**Google Business Profile Post**
- Publish 1 GBP post (rotate type)

**Review Monitoring**
- Check Google, Yelp, and Facebook for new reviews
- Respond to ALL reviews — positive and negative
- Positive review response template:
  ```
  "Thank you, [Name]! We appreciate you trusting us with your
  [project type]. It was a pleasure working with you. If you
  ever need anything in the future, don't hesitate to reach out!"
  ```
- Negative review response template:
  ```
  "Hi [Name], we're sorry to hear about your experience. We take
  all feedback seriously and would like to make this right.
  Please call us directly at [phone] so we can discuss this.
  Thank you."
  ```
  → Always take it offline. Never argue publicly.

**Review Generation Check**
- Ask client: "Any jobs completed this week? Let's get reviews from those customers."
- Send the review request template (see Section E)

---

### Week 3: Optimization

**Google Business Profile Post**
- Publish 1 GBP post (rotate type)

**Conversion Optimization Check**
- Review form submissions from the past 2 weeks — are they legit leads?
- Check page load speed (target: under 3 seconds)
- Review click-to-call functionality on mobile
- Check form delivery — are submissions reaching the client?
- Review top landing pages — any with high traffic but low conversion?
- A/B test headlines or CTAs if performance is flat
- Check Google Search Console for errors or indexing issues

**Quick Wins to Look For:**
- Pages ranking on page 2 → create supporting content to push to page 1
- High-traffic pages with no form → add a CTA
- Blog posts with no internal links → add links to service pages
- Service pages without testimonials → add one

Fall is the best time to get your gutters cleaned! Here's why... 🏠

before the first freeze saves you thousands in potential repairs.
Plus, most companies have shorter wait times in October vs. spring.

## D. MONTHLY REPORT CONTENTS

Every report must include these sections. Use **REPORT-TEMPLATE.md** for the actual format.

### Core Metrics

| Metric | What to Report |
|--------|---------------|
| **Website Visitors** | Total sessions, unique visitors, vs. last month |
| **Form Submissions** | Total leads from forms, conversion rate |
| **Phone Calls** | Tracked calls (if call tracking is set up) |
| **GBP Views** | Profile views, search impressions, actions |
| **Top Pages** | Top 5 pages by traffic |
| **Google Rankings** | Position changes for target keywords |
| **New Content** | Blog posts, service pages, GBP posts published |

### Analysis Sections

- **Executive Summary** — 3-4 sentences: how did the month go? Up, down, steady?
- **Lead Summary** — Total leads, quality assessment, any feedback from client
- **SEO Progress** — Ranking changes, new keywords appearing, indexing status
- **Content Published** — What was created and why
- **Recommendations** — 2-3 specific things to focus on next month
- **ROI Calculation** — Leads generated × average job value = estimated revenue generated

### ROI Calculation Formula

```
Leads Generated: [X]
Estimated Close Rate: 30-50% (ask client)
Average Job Value: $[X] (from kickoff call)
Estimated Revenue Generated: Leads × Close Rate × Job Value

Example:
8 leads × 40% close rate × $5,000 avg job = $16,000 estimated revenue
Monthly investment: $1,000
ROI: 16x return
```

**Always include this.** It's the number that keeps them paying $1,000/month.

---

## E. REVIEW GENERATION SYSTEM

Reviews are the #1 ranking factor for local SEO. This system should generate 2-5 new reviews per month for each client.

### The Process

1. **After each completed job**, the client sends this text to the customer:

```
Hey [customer name], thanks for choosing [company name]!
If you have a minute, a Google review would mean the world
to us: [direct Google review link]
```

2. **If no review after 3 days**, follow up once:

```
Hey [customer name], just following up — if you had a good
experience with us, we'd really appreciate a quick Google
review. Here's the link: [direct Google review link]
Thanks again!
```

3. **Do not follow up more than once.** Two messages total, max.

### How to Get the Direct Review Link

1. Go to Google Maps
2. Search for the client's business
3. Click on their listing
4. Click "Write a review"
5. Copy the URL — this is their direct review link
6. Use a URL shortener if needed for texting

**Alternative:** Google "Google review link generator" — several free tools create the direct link from the Place ID.

### Setting This Up with the Client

On the kickoff call or first monthly call:

```
"One thing that's going to make a huge difference is Google
reviews. Here's what I need from you: after every job, send
the customer a quick text asking for a review. I'll give you
the exact template and the link. It takes 10 seconds. Deal?"
```

**Make it stupid easy for them.** Give them the template pre-written. Give them the link ready to paste. If they have to think about it, they won't do it.

### Review Response Protocol

**5-star reviews:**
Respond within 24 hours. Personalize it.
```
"Thank you so much, [Name]! It was great working on your
[project type]. We appreciate your trust and the kind words.
Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything!"
```

**4-star reviews:**
Respond warmly. Don't address the missing star.
```
"Thanks for the review, [Name]! Glad we could help with your
[project]. We always strive for the best, and your feedback
helps us keep improving. Thanks again!"
```

**1-3 star reviews:**
Respond professionally. Take it offline immediately.
```
"Hi [Name], we're sorry to hear about your experience. We take
every piece of feedback seriously and want to make this right.
Could you give us a call at [phone]? We'd love the chance to
address your concerns directly."
```

**Never:**
- Argue with a negative review
- Get defensive
- Share details about the job publicly
- Ask someone to change their review in the public response

---

## F. QUARTERLY STRATEGY REVIEW (15 Minutes)

Every 3 months, replace the standard monthly call with a strategy review.

### Agenda

**1. Performance Recap (5 min)**
- Summarize the last 3 months of metrics
- Highlight trends (traffic up, leads steady, rankings improving)
- Celebrate wins ("You went from page 3 to page 1 for [keyword]")

**2. What's Working, What Isn't (5 min)**
- Which content is driving the most traffic/leads?
- Which service pages convert best?
- Any lead quality issues?
- Are they closing the leads they're getting?

**3. Strategy for Next Quarter (5 min)**
- Adjust content focus based on performance
- Discuss any business changes:
  - New services they want to promote
  - New areas they want to target
  - Seasonal shifts in demand
- Set goals for next quarter (leads, rankings, reviews)

### Upsell Opportunities

Don't force these. Bring them up naturally when the client is seeing results.

| Upsell | When to Pitch | Price |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Google Ads management | When organic leads are flowing and they want more volume | +$500-1,000/mo |
| Additional service area pages | When they expand to new cities | $500/page |
| Video content package | When they have strong project photos | $1,500 one-time |
| Social media management | When GBP is running well and they want broader presence | +$500/mo |
| Email marketing setup | When they have 100+ past customer contacts | $1,000 setup + $300/mo |

**How to pitch:**
```
"You're getting solid results from the organic system. If you
want to scale up faster, there's a paid ads layer we can add
that would put you at the top of Google immediately while the
organic keeps building. Want me to put together a proposal?"
```

→ Never hard sell. The results sell. Upsells should feel like natural next steps, not new pitches.

## G. CLIENT MANAGEMENT TOOLS

### Per-Client Tracking

For each client, maintain:
- [ ] Keyword tracking list (10-20 target keywords)
- [ ] Monthly metrics spreadsheet
- [ ] Content calendar (blog posts + GBP posts)
- [ ] Review generation tracking (reviews requested vs. received)
- [ ] Notes from monthly calls
- [ ] Invoice/payment status

### Time Management

With multiple clients, batch similar tasks:
- **Monday:** Write all blog posts for the week
- **Tuesday:** Create all GBP posts
- **Wednesday:** Review monitoring + responses for all clients
- **Thursday:** Technical checks and optimization for all clients
- **Friday:** Reports, admin, strategy planning

**Scale note:** At 5 clients = ~40-50 hours/month of work = manageable solo. At 10+ clients, start hiring a VA or content writer for blog posts and GBP posts.
