## THE 30-SECOND PITCH

```
"Hey [Name], this is Kae. I'm local here in Indy. I help
contractors like you get more inbound calls from homeowners
who are actively searching for your services online.

I looked at your setup and you're leaving leads on the table.
I put together a quick audit to show you exactly where. Open
to a 10-minute look?"
```

## PRICING

## TOP 3 OBJECTION RESPONSES

### "That's too expensive"
> "What's your average job worth? One job from this system pays for the entire setup. This isn't an expense — it's an investment that pays for itself the first month."

### "Let me think about it"
> "What specifically are you thinking over — the price, the timing, or something else? I only take one [trade] per area and your territory is open right now. Can't guarantee it'll be open next week."

### "I already have a website"
> "I saw it — that's why I called. Having a website and having one that generates leads are two different things. How many leads did your site bring you last month?"

---

## KEY STATS TO QUOTE

- **5-15 leads/month** — typical range from the system
- **2 weeks** — site goes live
- **30-60 days** — first leads start coming in
- **Month 3** — system hits its stride
- **One contractor per area** — exclusivity
- **$1K/mo investment** → typically generates **$10K-$30K+** in job revenue

## THE CLOSE

```
"I'll send the invoice right now. Once that's paid,
I start this week."
```
→ Send Stripe link. Stay on the phone. Wait for payment.
