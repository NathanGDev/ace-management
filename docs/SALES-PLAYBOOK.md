# ACE GROWTH — SALES PLAYBOOK

> This is the bible. Read it, know it, live it. Every call, every close, every follow-up runs through here.

---

## A. THE MINDSET

You are not selling websites. Read that again.

You are selling **leads, calls, and revenue**. You're selling a contractor the thing they actually want — the phone ringing with people who need their services. The website is just the machine that makes it happen. They don't care about the machine. They care about the money.

### Language Rules

**NEVER say:**
- "Web design"
- "SEO package"
- "Marketing services"
- "Digital marketing"
- "Online presence"
- "Build you a website"

**ALWAYS say:**
- "Lead generation system"
- "Inbound calls"
- "Conversion"
- "Revenue"
- "Growth system"
- "Leads on autopilot"
- "Your system"

### Who You Are

You're a **lead generation specialist** who builds systems that put contractors in front of homeowners who are actively looking for their services. You're not a web designer. You're not a marketing agency. You're the person who makes their phone ring.

### The Core Belief

Every contractor you talk to is leaving money on the table. Their website — if they even have one — is a digital brochure that does nothing. You're not asking them to spend money. You're showing them how to stop losing it.

### Confidence Anchors (remind yourself before every call)

- You know more about local lead generation than 99% of people they'll ever talk to
- You're offering exclusivity — one contractor per service area. That's real value.
- $3,000 is one job for most contractors. One job pays for the entire system.
- $1,000/month is nothing when the system generates 5-15 leads per month
- You're not begging. You're offering a limited opportunity.

---

## B. PROSPECTING — FINDING THEM

### Where to Find Contractors

**Google Maps (Primary)**
- Search "[service] near me" in Indianapolis and surrounding areas
- Look at the businesses ranking on page 2+ (they need help)
- Check their websites — bad site = hot prospect
- Note their Google review count and rating

**Yelp**
- Search contractor categories in Indy metro
- Sort by "most reviewed" — established businesses with volume
- Cross-reference their website quality

**Facebook**
- Local contractor groups
- Business pages with activity but no real website
- Community groups where contractors post

**Driving Around**
- Yard signs at job sites = active contractor
- Truck wraps with phone numbers
- Note the company name, Google them later

**HomeAdvisor / Angi / Thumbtack**
- Contractors paying for leads there are already spending money on marketing
- They're your warmest prospects — they understand paying for leads
- Their cost per lead on those platforms is $30-80+. You're cheaper and better.

**Referrals**
- After every close, ask: "Who else do you know in the trades — different service, obviously — who could use more leads?"
- Offer nothing in return. Just ask.

### What Makes a Good Prospect

✅ **Green Lights:**
- Bad or outdated website (or no website at all)
- In business 2+ years (established, not going anywhere)
- Answers their phone (shows they care about business)
- Has Google reviews (means they have customers)
- Runs a crew (not a one-man side hustle)
- Already spending money on ads or lead services
- Serves a defined geographic area

❌ **Red Flags — Walk Away:**
- Brand new business (< 1 year) — can't afford you, high failure rate
- Franchise operations — decisions made at corporate
- Already has a great, modern website — hard to show value
- Immediately asks "how much?" before hearing anything — price shopper
- Rude or dismissive on the phone — bad client, guaranteed headache
- No online presence at all AND no interest in growth — lifestyle business
- Owes money to other marketing companies — they'll owe you too

### Daily Activity Targets

| Activity | Target |
|----------|--------|
| Cold calls made | 10-15 |
| Audits sent | 3-5 |
| Audit walkthrough calls | 1-2 |
| Closes | 1 per 10-15 conversations |

**The math:** 15 calls → 5 conversations → 3 audits sent → 1 walkthrough → 1 close every 2-3 days. That's 2-3 new clients per week if you're consistent.

---

## C. THE COLD CALL SCRIPT

### The Opener

```
"Hey [Name], this is Kae. I'll be quick — I'm local here in Indy.
I was looking at your website and noticed you're probably missing
a few inbound calls a month because of how it's set up.

I actually put together a quick demo to show what I mean.
Open to taking a look?"
```

**Why this works:**
- "I'll be quick" — lowers resistance immediately
- "I'm local" — builds trust, you're not some out-of-state call center
- "missing inbound calls" — hits them where it hurts (money)
- "how it's set up" — implies a fixable problem, not an insult
- "quick demo" — low commitment, visual proof
- "Open to taking a look?" — soft close, easy yes

### Branch: YES (They're Interested)

```
"Perfect. What's a good email? I'll send it right now and
we can do a 10-minute walkthrough."
```

→ Get the email. Send the audit immediately. Book the walkthrough call for same day or next day. Strike while it's hot.

**If they want to do it right now:**
```
"Even better. Pull up your email — I'm sending it now.
Got it? Great, let me walk you through what I found."
```

→ Go straight into the Audit Walkthrough (Section D).

### Branch: BUSY (Not a No)

```
"No worries — when's a better time to call back?
I'll make it quick, 10 minutes tops."
```

→ Get a specific day and time. Put it in your calendar. Call back exactly when you said you would.

**If they're vague ("call me next week"):**
```
"For sure. Tuesday or Thursday better for you?
Morning or afternoon? Cool — I'll call you [day] around [time]."
```

→ Pin them down. Vague = forgotten.

### Branch: NO / NOT INTERESTED

```
"Fair enough. Quick question before I go — are you getting
enough leads from your website right now, or is it mostly referrals?"
```

**Why this works:** It reopens the conversation. Most contractors will admit their website doesn't generate leads. Now you're having a conversation, not making a pitch.

**If they say "mostly referrals":**
```
"That's what I figured. Referrals are great, but they dry up.
What happens when a slow month hits? That's exactly what this
system prevents. Let me send you a quick audit — takes 2 minutes
to look at. If it's not useful, delete it. Fair?"
```

**If they say "we're busy enough":**
```
"That's a good problem. But here's the thing — you're busy now.
What about January? February? The system I build works year-round
so you never hit a valley. Worth a 10-minute look?"
```

### Branch: HOSTILE (Rude, Aggressive, Cursing)

```
"I hear you. If things change, I'm at (317) 572-7018.
Have a good one."
```

→ Plant the seed. Move on. Don't take it personally. Some of these guys will call back in 3 months when work slows down.

**Never:**
- Argue back
- Get defensive
- Try to convince a hostile prospect
- Waste more than 10 seconds after hostility

---

## D. THE AUDIT WALKTHROUGH (15-Minute Call)

This is where the sale happens. The audit does the selling for you. Your job is to guide them through it and connect every issue to money they're losing.

### Step 1: Frame Control (1 minute)

```
"Hey [Name], thanks for taking the time. Quick heads up — this
isn't a sales call. I just want to show you what I found when I
looked at your online setup. Some of it might surprise you.
You ready?"
```

**Why frame control matters:**
- "Not a sales call" drops their guard
- "What I found" creates curiosity
- "Might surprise you" builds anticipation
- You're the expert showing findings, not a salesman pitching

### Step 2: Walk the Audit (5 minutes)

Go through each category score. Be specific. Point to real issues.

**For each problem area:**
```
"See this section here? Your [specific issue]. What that means is
when someone Googles '[their service] in [their city],' they're
finding your competitor instead of you. That's a lead you lost."
```

**Key phrases to use:**
- "That's a lead walking to your competitor"
- "Every day this stays like this, you're leaving money on the table"
- "This is a quick fix that makes a big difference"
- "Google penalizes this — that's why you're not showing up"

**Don't:**
- Get technical ("your H1 tags are wrong")
- Overwhelm with jargon
- Rush through it — let each point sink in

### Step 3: The Competitor Gap (3 minutes)

```
"Now let me show you something interesting. I pulled up [competitor name]
— they're down the road from you. See the difference? They've got
[specific things: reviews, fast site, clear CTAs, service pages].
That's why they're showing up above you on Google."
```

**This creates urgency.** They can see, right now, that their competitor is eating their lunch. Make it visual. Make it specific.

```
"The good news? None of this is hard to fix. And once we fix it,
you're the one showing up instead of them."
```

### Step 4: Tie to Money (2 minutes)

This is the pivot. Stop talking about websites and start talking about dollars.

```
"Quick question — what's your average job worth?"
```

Wait for the answer. Let's say they say $5,000.

```
"Okay, so $5,000. The system I build typically generates 5-15 new
leads per month. Even if you only close 2 or 3 of those, that's
$10,000-$15,000 in new revenue. Every month. And the whole system
costs less than one job to set up."
```

**Let that math do the talking.** Don't rush past it. Let them do the calculation in their head.

### Step 5: Price + Silence (2 minutes)

```
"Here's how it works. It's $3,000 one-time to build the entire
system — the website, the SEO, the Google Business optimization,
everything. Then $1,000 a month to keep the leads flowing —
that's the ongoing optimization, content, and monitoring.

And I only work with one [their trade] per area, so once your
territory is locked in, your competitors can't get this."
```

**Now STOP TALKING.**

Silence. Dead silence. Do not speak. Do not add "so what do you think?" Do not soften the price. Do not explain more.

**Whoever talks first loses.** If there are 10 seconds of silence, let there be 10 seconds of silence. They're processing. Let them.

### Step 6: Handle Objections (if any)

See Section E below. Whatever they say, you have a response ready.

### Step 7: Close

Once they agree (or you've handled the objection):

```
"Perfect. I'll send the invoice right now. Once that's paid,
I start this week. You should see it in your email in about
30 seconds."
```

→ Send the Stripe link immediately. Stay on the phone until they pay.

```
"Did you get it? Great. Go ahead and knock that out and
we'll get your kickoff call scheduled."
```

---

## E. OBJECTION HANDLING

Every objection is either a **question in disguise** or a **stall tactic**. Know the difference and respond accordingly.

---

### "That's too expensive" / "Can you do it cheaper?"

```
"I get it — $3,000 sounds like a lot. But let me put it this way.
What's your average job worth? [$X]. So one job from this system
pays for the entire setup. And the $1,000 a month? If the system
brings you even one extra job per month — and it will bring more —
you're making money, not spending it.

This isn't an expense. It's an investment that pays for itself
the first month."
```

**If they push harder on price:**
```
"I hear you. But I don't do discounts — and here's why. The
contractors who get results from this are the ones who invest in
it properly. I'd rather do it right for fewer people than do it
cheap for everyone. This is the price because this is what it
takes to actually generate leads."
```

**Never discount. Ever.** The moment you negotiate price, you've told them your service isn't worth what you quoted.

---

### "Let me think about it"

```
"Totally fair. What specifically are you thinking over?
Is it the price, the timing, or something else?"
```

**Why this works:** "Let me think about it" is almost never about thinking. It's about an unspoken objection. This question forces the real objection to the surface.

**If they can't articulate it:**
```
"I'll tell you what — I only take one [their trade] per area.
Right now, your territory is open. I can't guarantee it will be
next week. I'd hate for you to think about it and then find out
your competitor locked it up."
```

→ Urgency. Scarcity. Both are real.

---

### "I already have a website" / "I have a guy"

```
"I saw your website — that's actually why I called. Having a
website and having a website that generates leads are two
completely different things. Most contractor websites are
basically online business cards. They look okay, but they
don't actually make the phone ring.

How many leads did your website bring you last month?
Can your current guy tell you that number?"
```

**The answer is almost always "I don't know" or "not many."** That's your opening.

```
"That's exactly the problem I solve. My system is built from
the ground up to convert visitors into calls. It's not just a
pretty page — it's a lead generation machine."
```

---

### "I get all my work from referrals"

```
"Referrals are great — seriously, that means you do good work.
But let me ask you something: what happens when referrals slow
down? What do you do in January or February when the phone
stops ringing?

This system doesn't replace referrals. It adds a second stream
of leads that works 24/7 whether someone refers you or not.
Best contractors I work with have both — referrals AND inbound
leads. That way you're never waiting for the phone to ring."
```

---

### "I tried marketing before and it didn't work"

```
"I hear that a lot, and honestly, it's usually because whoever
did it was selling you a 'marketing package' — some SEO, maybe
some social media posts, a logo redesign. That stuff doesn't
generate leads.

What I do is different. I build a system specifically designed
to show up when someone Googles '[their service] near me' and
convert that visitor into a phone call. That's it. No fluff,
no vanity metrics. Leads and calls.

What did the last company actually do for you?"
```

→ Let them vent. Then differentiate yourself clearly from whatever burned them before.

---

### "How long until I see results?"

```
"Good question. The website goes live within two weeks. You'll
start seeing traffic within the first 30 days. Most clients get
their first leads within 30-60 days, and the system really hits
its stride around month 3.

But here's the thing — the sooner we start, the sooner it
compounds. SEO is a snowball. Every month it builds on itself.
Starting today means you're ahead by month 3, not month 6."
```

---

### "I don't have time for this"

```
"That's actually the best part — you don't need time. I build
everything. I manage everything. The only thing I need from you
is 30 minutes upfront to get your info, and a 15-minute check-in
call once a month. That's it.

You focus on the jobs. I focus on filling your pipeline."
```

---

### "Send me some info" (Stall Tactic)

```
"I'll do you one better — I already put together an audit
specific to your business. It's not a generic brochure. Let me
send that over and we'll spend 10 minutes walking through it.
That'll tell you everything you need to know.

What's the best email?"
```

→ Don't send a PDF or a brochure. Send the audit. Get them on a walkthrough call. "Send me info" without a scheduled callback is where deals go to die.

**If they insist on just getting info:**
```
"For sure. I'll send the audit. But honestly, it makes a lot more
sense when I walk you through it — takes 10 minutes and you'll see
exactly what I mean. How about I send it now and we do a quick call
tomorrow at [time]?"
```

→ Always attach a callback.

---

### "I need to talk to my partner / wife"

```
"Absolutely — it's a business decision, makes sense to loop them
in. Here's what I'd suggest: let me send you the audit and a
quick summary of what we talked about. That way you can show them
exactly what this is. Can we set up a call for [day] so I can
answer any questions they have too?"
```

→ Offer to get on a call with the decision-maker. Don't let the prospect become your salesperson — they won't sell it as well as you.

---

### "What's included exactly?"

```
"Everything you need to generate leads online. Here's the
breakdown:

The $3,000 setup covers:
- Custom lead-generation website built for your trade and area
- Google Business Profile optimization
- On-page SEO for your service areas
- Conversion-optimized design — calls-to-action, click-to-call,
  forms, the works
- Mobile-first design (most people search on their phone)

The $1,000/month covers:
- Ongoing SEO and content creation
- Weekly Google Business Profile posts
- Monthly performance reporting
- Review generation strategy
- Conversion optimization — I'm constantly tweaking to get
  more leads
- A dedicated 15-minute monthly strategy call

And the big one — exclusivity. I only work with one [their trade]
in your area. Your competitors can't get this."
```

---

### "Can I see examples of your work?"

```
"For sure. I'll show you what I've built — but more importantly,
I'll show you the results. Because a pretty website that doesn't
generate leads is worthless. Let me pull up a couple examples on
our walkthrough call."
```

→ Have 2-3 demo sites or client sites ready to show. Always lead with results (leads, calls, rankings), not design.

---

### "Why should I trust you?"

```
"Fair question. Here's the deal — I'm local. I'm in Indy. I'm not
some agency in another state that's going to disappear. You have
my cell number. I'm building my business the same way you built
yours — by doing good work and letting results speak.

And here's the thing: I only take one contractor per service area.
If I don't get you results, I can't fill that spot with someone
else. My business depends on yours succeeding. We're aligned."
```

---

## F. FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE

After the initial call and audit send, you have 7 days. That's it.

### Day 0: The Call + Audit Send
- Make the cold call
- If interested, send the audit immediately
- Try to do the walkthrough same-call or schedule for next day

### Day 1: The Text

```
Hey [Name], it's Kae. Did you get a chance to look at
that growth audit I sent over? Let me know if you have
any questions — happy to walk through it.
```

### Day 3: The Callback

Call them directly. Keep it casual.

```
"Hey [Name], it's Kae — just following up on that growth
audit I sent. Did you get a chance to look at it?"
```

→ If they did: move into the walkthrough or re-address objections.
→ If they didn't: "No worries, pull it up real quick — I'll walk you through the highlights. It'll take 5 minutes."

### Day 7: The Final Text

```
Hey [Name], last follow-up from me. The offer stands
if you want to lock in your area. I'm at (317) 572-7018
if anything changes. Good luck out there.
```

### After Day 7: Move On

Do not chase. Do not call again. Do not text again.

**Why:** Chasing kills your positioning. You're the expert with a limited offer, not a salesman begging for business. Some will come back. Most won't. That's fine — there are 10,000 contractors in Indy.

---

## G. CLOSING & PAYMENT

### Payment Structure

| Fee | Amount | Link |
|-----|--------|------|
| Setup (one-time) | $3,000 | [Pay Setup Fee](https://buy.stripe.com/5kQ00jg0i6NC0bcbkeeEo0A) |
| Monthly | $1,000/mo | [Start Monthly](https://buy.stripe.com/8x29AT8xQ7RGgaacoieEo0B) |

### The Close Process

1. **Price delivered.** Silence. Wait for their response.
2. **Objection handled** (if needed). See Section E.
3. **Agreement received.** They say yes, sounds good, let's do it, etc.
4. **Send the invoice immediately:**
   ```
   "Perfect. I'm sending the setup invoice right now. You should
   see it in your email in about 30 seconds."
   ```
5. **Stay on the phone.** Wait for them to pay.
   ```
   "Did you get it? Great. Go ahead and take care of that
   and we'll get your project started this week."
   ```
6. **Payment confirmed.** Schedule the kickoff call.
   ```
   "Got it — you're locked in. Let's set up your kickoff call.
   I need about 30 minutes to get all your info. How's [day] at [time]?"
   ```

### Rules

- **Collect setup fee BEFORE starting any work.** No exceptions. No "I'll pay half now." Full setup fee or you don't start.
- **Send the Stripe link, not a bank account.** Professional, trackable, instant.
- **Monthly billing starts when the site goes live.** Not before.
- **If they want to pay by check** — redirect to Stripe. "The system processes everything through our secure payment portal. It takes 30 seconds."

---

## H. RULES — NON-NEGOTIABLE

These are the laws. They don't bend.

### 1. Never Discount
The price is the price. $3,000 setup. $1,000/month. Not $2,500. Not $800. Not "the first month free." If they can't afford it, they're not your client. Move on.

### 2. Never Say "Free"
Nothing is free. Free devalues everything. The audit is a "growth audit" or "lead generation audit" — never a "free audit." You invested time in creating it. It has value.

### 3. Never Over-Explain the Tech
They don't care about schema markup, Core Web Vitals, or canonical tags. They care about leads. When they ask "how does it work?" the answer is: "I build a system that puts you in front of people actively searching for your service. When they find you, the system converts them into a call or a form fill. You answer the phone, close the job."

### 4. Silence After Price
Drop the price. Stop talking. If there are 30 seconds of silence, let there be 30 seconds of silence. The first person to speak after the price loses leverage. You gave them the number. Let them process it.

### 5. No Chasing After Day 7
The follow-up sequence is 7 days. After that, they're dead to you. If they come back in 3 months, great. But you don't call them. You don't text them. You move to the next prospect.

### 6. One Contractor Per Service Area
This is real. This is your biggest leverage. When you say "I only work with one roofer in Carmel," you mean it. This creates urgency and exclusivity. If they pass, their competitor gets the spot. Make sure they understand that.

### 7. Never Badmouth Their Current Setup
Don't say "your website sucks." Say "your website isn't set up to generate leads." Big difference. One insults them. The other identifies an opportunity. You're helping, not judging.

### 8. Always Control the Next Step
Every interaction ends with a clear next step:
- "I'll send the audit and call you tomorrow at 2."
- "I'll send the invoice right now."
- "Let's schedule your kickoff for Thursday."

Never end with "let me know" or "get back to me whenever." You control the timeline.
