# ♠️ ACE GROWTH — THE VISION

## Where This Goes

Right now: Kae sells, Ace builds. Manual cold calls, one client at a time.

**Phase 1: The Machine (NOW — Month 1-2)**
- One-command pipeline: give Ace a URL → auto-research → auto-audit → auto-demo → deployed and ready to sell
- Kae cold calls 10/day, Ace has the ammo pre-loaded every morning
- Close 3 contractors → $12K + $3K MRR
- Fulfillment is 90% automated (template generator + SOPs)

**Phase 2: Inbound Engine (Month 2-4)**
- acegrowth.net becomes a lead magnet — blog content targeting "contractor marketing Indianapolis"
- Free audit tool on the site: contractor enters their URL, gets an instant score
- SEO compounds: contractors find US instead of us finding them
- Kae stops cold calling, starts closing warm inbound leads
- Target: 5-10 inbound leads/month

**Phase 3: Multi-Vertical Expansion (Month 3-6)**
- Not just contractors. Real estate (aunt), restaurants, law firms, dentists, auto shops
- Each vertical gets its own template, audit framework, and sales playbook
- Same $3K + $1K/mo model, different niches
- Kae picks verticals based on who's in the network (aunt = real estate)
- Target: 10+ clients across 3 verticals

**Phase 4: Scale Beyond Kae (Month 6-12)**
- White-label the system: other salespeople sell the same package, Kae takes a cut
- Commission-only sales reps in other cities (Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago)
- Ace handles ALL fulfillment — zero additional overhead
- Client dashboard: each client logs in, sees their leads, rankings, reports
- Target: 25+ clients, $25K+ MRR

**Phase 5: Platform (Year 2)**
- Self-serve audit tool: businesses pay $49/month for automated audits + recommendations
- Agency marketplace: Ace Growth becomes the fulfillment layer for dozens of salespeople
- Recurring revenue at scale with near-zero marginal cost
- The AI agency that runs itself

## The Moat

Every client we sign, every audit we generate, every site we build — Ace gets smarter. We learn what converts, what ranks, what sells. That data compounds. By the time competitors figure out what we're doing, we've already automated the next 10 steps.

## What Gets Built Next (Right Now)

1. **One-Command Pipeline** — `prospect-pipeline.sh [url]` → researches, audits, builds demo, deploys. One command, 5 minutes, ready to sell.
2. **Real Estate Template** — For Kae's aunt and future real estate clients. New vertical, new revenue stream.
3. **Inbound SEO Content** — Blog posts on acegrowth.net targeting contractor searches. Start the inbound engine.
